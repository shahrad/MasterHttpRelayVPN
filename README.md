**[🇮🇷 راهنماییی فارسی (Persian)](README_FA.md)**

A free tool that lets you access the internet freely by hiding your traffic behind trusted websites like Google. No VPS or server needed — just a free Google account.

> **How it works in simple terms:** Your browser talks to this tool on your computer. This tool disguises your traffic to look like normal Google traffic. The firewall/filter sees "google.com" and lets it pass. Behind the scenes, a free Google Apps Script relay fetches the real website for you.

## How It Works

```
Browser -> Local Proxy -> Google/CDN front -> Your relay -> Target website
             |
             +-> shows google.com to the network filter
```

In normal use, the browser sends traffic to the proxy running on your computer.
The proxy sends that traffic through Google-facing infrastructure so the network only sees an allowed domain such as `www.google.com`.
Your deployed relay then fetches the real website and sends the response back through the same path.

This means the filter sees normal-looking Google traffic, while the actual destination stays hidden inside the relay request.

---

## Quick Start (Recommended)

One command sets up a virtualenv, installs dependencies, launches an interactive
config wizard, and starts the proxy.

**Windows:**
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/masterking32/MasterHttpRelayVPN.git
cd MasterHttpRelayVPN
start.bat
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/masterking32/MasterHttpRelayVPN.git
cd MasterHttpRelayVPN
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

The first time it runs, the wizard asks for your Google Apps Script Deployment ID
and generates a strong random password for you. Follow the Apps Script deployment
instructions in **Step 2** below before running the wizard so you have a
Deployment ID ready.

## Project Structure

- `src/core/` shared modules (config constants, logging, cert install, LAN, scanner)
- `src/proxy/` local proxy runtime (HTTP/SOCKS, MITM, proxy helpers)
- `src/relay/` Apps Script relay runtime (relay engine, parsing, H2, helpers)
- `apps_script/` deployable edge/runtime scripts
- `docs/exit-node/` exit-node deployment guides

After it's running, jump to **Step 5** (browser proxy) and **Step 6** (CA
certificate).

---

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide (Manual)

### Step 1: Download This Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masterking32/MasterHttpRelayVPN.git
cd MasterHttpRelayVPN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Can't reach PyPI directly?** Use this mirror instead:
> ```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirror-pypi.runflare.com/simple/ --trusted-host mirror-pypi.runflare.com
> ```

Or download the ZIP from [GitHub](https://github.com/masterking32/MasterHttpRelayVPN) and extract it.

### Step 2: Set Up the Google Relay (Code.gs)

This is the "relay" that sits on Google's servers and fetches websites for you. It's free.

1. Open [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.
2. Click **New project**.
3. **Delete** all the default code in the editor.
4. Open the [`Code.gs`](apps_script/Code.gs) file from this project (under `apps_script/`), **copy everything**, and paste it into the Apps Script editor.
5. **Important:** Change the password on this line to something only you know:
   ```javascript
   const AUTH_KEY = "your-secret-password-here";
   ```
6. Click **Deploy** → **New deployment**.
7. Choose **Web app** as the type.
8. Set:
   - **Execute as:** Me
   - **Who has access:** Anyone
9. Click **Deploy**.
10. **Copy the Deployment ID** (it looks like a long random string). You'll need it in the next step.

> ⚠️ Remember the password you set in step 5. You'll use the same password in the config file below.

### Step 3: Configure

**Option A — interactive wizard (recommended):**
```bash
python setup.py
```
It'll prompt for your Deployment ID, generate a random `auth_key`, and write
`config.json` for you.

**Option B — manual:**

1. Copy the example config file:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.json config.json
   ```
   On Windows, you can also just copy & rename the file manually.

2. Open `config.json` in any text editor and fill in your values:
   ```json
   {
     "mode": "apps_script",
     "google_ip": "216.239.38.120",
     "front_domain": "www.google.com",
     "script_id": "PASTE_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID_HERE",
     "auth_key": "your-secret-password-here",
     "listen_host": "127.0.0.1",
     "listen_port": 8085,
     "socks5_enabled": true,
     "socks5_port": 1080,
     "log_level": "INFO",
     "verify_ssl": true
   }
   ```
   - `script_id` → Paste the Deployment ID from Step 2.
   - `auth_key` → The **same password** you set in `Code.gs`.

### Step 3.5: Optional Exit Node for Full-Tunnel (ChatGPT/Turnstile Friendly)

Some websites block Google datacenter IPs when traffic exits directly from Apps Script.
To fix that, configure an exit node so traffic path becomes:

```text
Browser -> Local Proxy -> Apps Script -> Exit Node (Val Town / Cloudflare / Deno) -> Target website
```

You can deploy any one of these free exit-node templates:

1. Val Town: [`apps_script/valtown.ts`](apps_script/valtown.ts)
2. Cloudflare Workers: [`apps_script/cloudflare_worker.js`](apps_script/cloudflare_worker.js)
3. Deno Deploy: [`apps_script/deno_deploy.ts`](apps_script/deno_deploy.ts)

Full step-by-step deployment guide (all providers):
- [docs/exit-node/EXIT_NODE_DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/exit-node/EXIT_NODE_DEPLOYMENT.md)

Set the same PSK secret inside the exit-node code (`PSK` constant) and in `config.json`.

Then configure provider switching like this:

```json
"exit_node": {
  "enabled": true,
  "provider": "valtown",
  "url": "https://YOUR-NAME.web.val.run",
  "psk": "CHANGE_ME_TO_A_STRONG_SECRET",
  "mode": "full",
  "hosts": [
    "chatgpt.com",
    "openai.com",
    "claude.ai",
    "anthropic.com"
  ]
}
```

Notes:
- For noob setup, only fill `provider`, `url`, and `psk`.
- Switch provider by changing `exit_node.provider` and `exit_node.url`.
- `mode: "full"` = everything goes through exit node (ignore `hosts`).
- `mode: "selective"` = only domains in `hosts` go through exit node.
- `psk` must exactly match your deployed exit node secret.

Production recommendation:
- Keep `verify_ssl: true`
- Keep `listen_host: 127.0.0.1` unless LAN sharing is explicitly needed
- Rotate both secrets periodically
- Never publish your live val URL with valid PSK

### Step 4: Run

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You should see a message saying the HTTP proxy is running on `127.0.0.1:8085` and SOCKS5 on `127.0.0.1:1080`.

### Step 5: Set Up Your Browser

Set your browser to use the proxy:

- **Proxy Address:** `127.0.0.1`
- **Proxy Port:** `8085`
- **Type:** HTTP
- **Optional SOCKS5 Port:** `1080`

**How to set proxy in common browsers:**
- **Firefox:** Settings → General → Network Settings → Manual proxy → enter `127.0.0.1` port `8085` for HTTP Proxy → check "Also use this proxy for HTTPS"
- **Chrome/Edge:** Uses system proxy. Go to Windows Settings → Network → Proxy → Manual setup → enter `127.0.0.1:8085`
- **Or** use extensions like [FoxyProxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) or [SwitchyOmega](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/) for easier switching.

### Step 6: Install the CA Certificate (Required for HTTPS)

When using `apps_script` mode, the tool needs to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS traffic locally. It generates a CA certificate on first run. **You must install it** or you'll see security warnings on every website.

The certificate file is created at `ca/ca.crt` inside the project folder after the first run.

#### Windows
1. Double-click `ca/ca.crt`.
2. Click **Install Certificate**.
3. Choose **Current User** (or Local Machine for all users).
4. Select **Place all certificates in the following store** → click **Browse** → choose **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.
5. Click **Next** → **Finish**.
6. Restart your browser.

#### macOS
1. Double-click `ca/ca.crt` — it opens in Keychain Access.
2. It goes into the **login** keychain.
3. Find the certificate, double-click it.
4. Click on View Certificate then expand **Trust** → set **When using this certificate** to **Always Trust**.
5. Select System in the Keychain section and press add button.
6. Close and enter your password. Restart your browser.

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo cp ca/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/masterhttp-relay.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```
Restart your browser.

#### Firefox (All Platforms)
Firefox uses its own certificate store, so even after OS-level install you need to do this:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Certificates** → **View Certificates**.
2. Go to the **Authorities** tab → click **Import**.
3. Select `ca/ca.crt` from the project folder.
4. Check **Trust this CA to identify websites** → click **OK**.

> **Auto-install on startup:** When running in `apps_script` mode the proxy will automatically detect if the CA is not yet trusted and attempt to install it for you. If it succeeds you'll see a confirmation in the log; if it fails (e.g. needs administrator rights) it will print instructions. You can also run `python main.py --install-cert` at any time to (re-)install the certificate.

> **Uninstalling:** To remove the certificate from your system's trust stores, run `python main.py --uninstall-cert` or use `start.bat --uninstall-cert` on Windows. This removes the certificate from all system trust stores and Firefox profiles.

> ⚠️ **Security note:** This certificate only works locally on your machine. Don't share the `ca/` folder with anyone. If you want to start fresh, delete the `ca/` folder and the tool will generate a new one.

---

## LAN Sharing (Optional)

By default, the proxy only listens on `127.0.0.1` (localhost), meaning only your computer can use it. To allow other devices on your local network (LAN) to use the proxy:

1. Set `"lan_sharing": true` in your `config.json`
2. The proxy will automatically listen on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)
3. The startup log will show your LAN IP addresses that other devices can connect to

**Example LAN configuration:**
```json
{
  "lan_sharing": true,
  "listen_host": "0.0.0.0",
  "listen_port": 8085
}
```

**Security Warning:** When LAN sharing is enabled, anyone on your local network can use your proxy. Ensure your network is trusted and consider additional security measures.

**On other devices:** Configure them to use your computer's LAN IP (shown in the startup log) and port 8085 as the HTTP proxy.

---

## Modes Overview

This project is centered on the **Apps Script** relay (free, no VPS needed). For destinations that block Google egress, you can optionally chain a free edge exit node (Val Town, Cloudflare Workers, or Deno Deploy).

---

## Configuration Options

### Main Settings

| Setting | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `auth_key` | Password shared between your computer and the relay |
| `script_id` | Your Google Apps Script Deployment ID |
| `listen_host` | Where to listen (`127.0.0.1` = only this computer, `0.0.0.0` = all interfaces for LAN sharing) |
| `listen_port` | Which port to listen on (default: `8085`) |
| `lan_sharing` | Enable LAN sharing to allow other devices on your network to use the proxy (`false` by default) |
| `log_level` | How much detail to show: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` |

### Advanced Settings

| Setting | Default | What It Does |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `google_ip` | `216.239.38.120` | Google IP address to connect through |
| `front_domain` | `www.google.com` | Domain shown to the firewall/filter |
| `verify_ssl` | `true` | Verify the TLS certificate on the local fronted connection to Google/CDN |
| `relay_timeout` | `25` | Total timeout for one relayed request before it fails |
| `tls_connect_timeout` | `15` | Timeout for the proxy's TLS connection to the fronted Google/CDN endpoint |
| `tcp_connect_timeout` | `10` | Timeout for direct TCP tunnels and outbound SNI-rewrite connects |
| `max_response_body_bytes` | `209715200` | Hard cap for a single relay response body after buffering/decoding |
| `script_ids` | — | Multiple Script IDs for load balancing (array) |
| `chunked_download_extensions` | see [config.example.json](config.example.json) | File extensions that should use parallel range downloading. Supports `".*"` to probe all GET downloads. |
| `chunked_download_min_size` | `5242880` | Minimum total file size (5 MB) before range-parallel download stays enabled |
| `chunked_download_chunk_size` | `524288` | Per-range chunk size used by parallel downloads |
| `chunked_download_max_parallel` | `8` | Maximum simultaneous range requests for one download |
| `chunked_download_max_chunks` | `256` | Soft upper bound for total chunk requests; chunk size is raised automatically for very large files |
| `block_hosts` | `[]` | Hosts that must never be tunneled (return HTTP 403). Supports exact names (`ads.example.com`) or leading-dot suffixes (`.doubleclick.net`). |
| `bypass_hosts` | `["localhost", ".local", ".lan", ".home.arpa"]` | Hosts that go direct (no MITM, no relay). Useful for LAN resources or sites that break under MITM. |
| `direct_google_exclude` | see [config.example.json](config.example.json) | Google apps that must use the MITM relay path instead of the fast direct tunnel. |
| `hosts` | `{}` | Manual DNS override: map a hostname to a specific IP. |
| `youtube_via_relay` | `false` | Route YouTube (`youtube.com`, `youtu.be`, `youtube-nocookie.com`) through the Apps Script relay instead of the SNI-rewrite path. The SNI-rewrite path uses Google's frontend IP which enforces SafeSearch and can cause **"Video Unavailable"** errors. Setting this to `true` fixes playback at the cost of using more Apps Script executions and slightly higher latency. |
| `exit_node.provider` | `valtown` | Selected exit-node backend: `valtown`, `cloudflare`, `deno`, or `custom`. |
| `exit_node.url` | `""` | Beginner-friendly single URL for the selected provider. |

### Optional Dependencies

Install everything from [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). All listed packages are optional — the proxy runs with no third-party dependencies in basic modes, but without them you lose features:

| Package | Provides |
|---------|----------|
| `cryptography` | MITM TLS interception (required for `apps_script` mode with HTTPS sites) |
| `h2` | HTTP/2 multiplexing to the Apps Script relay (significantly faster) |
| `brotli` | Decompression of `Content-Encoding: br` responses |
| `zstandard` | Decompression of `Content-Encoding: zstd` responses |


### Load Balancing

To increase speed, deploy `Code.gs` multiple times to different Apps Script projects and use all their IDs:

```json
{
  "script_ids": [
    "DEPLOYMENT_ID_1",
    "DEPLOYMENT_ID_2",
    "DEPLOYMENT_ID_3"
  ]
}
```
> ⚠️ **Note:** If you are using multiple deployments, the auth-keys must be identical. (All deployments must use the same auth-key.)
---

## Updating the Google Relay

If you change `Code.gs`, you must **create a new deployment** in Google Apps Script (Deploy → New deployment) and **update the `script_id`** in your `config.json`. Just editing the code does not update the live version.

---

## Command Line Options

```bash
python3 main.py                          # Normal start
python3 main.py -p 9090                  # Use HTTP port 9090 instead
python3 main.py --socks5-port 1081       # Use SOCKS5 port 1081
python3 main.py --disable-socks5         # Disable SOCKS5 listener
python3 main.py --log-level DEBUG        # Show detailed logs
python3 main.py -c /path/to/config.json  # Use a different config file
python3 main.py --install-cert           # Install MITM CA certificate and exit
python3 main.py --uninstall-cert         # Remove MITM CA certificate and exit
python3 main.py --no-cert-check          # Skip automatic CA install check on startup
python3 main.py --scan                   # Scan Google IPs and find the fastest one
```

> **Auto-install:** On startup (MITM mode), the proxy automatically checks if the CA certificate is trusted and attempts to install it. Use `--no-cert-check` to skip this. If auto-install fails (e.g. needs elevation), run `python main.py --install-cert` manually or follow Step 6 above.

### Scanning for the Fastest Google IP

If your current `google_ip` in `config.json` is blocked or slow, you can scan to find a faster one:

```bash
python3 main.py --scan
```

This will:
1. Probe 27 candidate Google IPs in parallel
2. Measure latency from your network
3. Display results in a table
4. Recommend the fastest IP
5. Exit with exit code 0 if at least one IP is reachable, 1 otherwise

**Example output:**
```
Scanning 27 Google frontend IPs
  SNI: www.google.com
  Timeout: 4s per IP
  Concurrency: 8 parallel probes

IP                   LATENCY      STATUS
-------------------- ------------ -------------------------
216.239.32.120          42ms   OK
216.239.34.120          45ms   OK
216.239.36.120          52ms   OK
142.250.80.142       timeout   timeout
...

Result: 15 / 27 reachable

Top 3 fastest IPs:
  1. 216.239.32.120 (42ms)
  2. 216.239.34.120 (45ms)
  3. 216.239.36.120 (52ms)

Recommended: Set "google_ip": "216.239.32.120" in config.json
```

After scanning, update your `config.json` with the recommended IP and restart the proxy.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Config not found" | Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill in your values |
| Browser shows certificate errors | Install the CA certificate (see Step 6 above) |
| Telegram works but browser doesn't load sites | Almost certainly the CA certificate is not installed. Follow Step 6 to install `ca/ca.crt`, then **fully close and reopen your browser** (for Chrome/Edge, make sure no Chrome process is running in the background before reopening). |
| Installed the cert but browser still errors | Chrome and Edge cache certificates — you must **completely close** the browser (check Task Manager / system tray) and reopen it for the new cert to take effect. Firefox requires a separate import (see Step 6 Firefox section). |
| "unauthorized" error | Make sure `auth_key` in `config.json` matches `AUTH_KEY` in `Code.gs` exactly |
| Connection timeout | Try a different `google_ip` or check your internet connection |
| Slow browsing | Deploy multiple `Code.gs` copies and use `script_ids` array for load balancing |
| `502 Bad JSON` error | Google returned an unexpected response (HTML instead of JSON). Causes: wrong `script_id`, Apps Script daily quota exhausted, or the deployment wasn't re-created after editing `Code.gs`. Check your `script_id` and create a **new deployment** if you recently changed `Code.gs`. |
| Telegram works on HTTP proxy but not on SOCKS5 | **Expected.** SOCKS5 clients resolve hostnames locally and connect to raw IPs, so Telegram's MTProto-obfuscated bytes reach a blocked IP that we can neither direct-tunnel nor intercept. Configure Telegram as an **HTTP proxy** (`127.0.0.1:8085`) instead — it sends hostnames, which the proxy handles via SNI-rewrite through Google. |
| Google and YouTube open but YouTube videos don't play and other sites don't load | The connection to `script.google.com` was not successfully established. This is likely caused by an issue with the deployment of `Code.gs` on Google Apps Script, or the daily execution quota has been exhausted. Re-deploy `Code.gs` with a new deployment and verify your `script_id`, or wait until the quota resets (midnight Pacific Time / 10:30 AM Iran Time). |

## Security Tips

- **Never share your `config.json`** — it has your password in it.
- **Change the default `AUTH_KEY`** in `Code.gs` before deploying.
- **Don't share the `ca/` folder** — it contains your private certificate key.
- Keep `listen_host` as `127.0.0.1` so only your computer can use the proxy.
- Every google scripts deployment has limit of 20,000 requests in 24 hours
